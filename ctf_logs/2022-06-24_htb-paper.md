description: 'Writeup for Paper, an easy HTB box with a tiny bit of code review.'
---

Paper is an easy HackTheBox machine created by [secnigma](https://secnigma.wordpress.com/). It showcases a Wordpress authentication bypass vulnerability, the tiniest bit of source code review, and a classic CVE -> Github -> Root scenario. It was only on putting together this writeup that I noticed that the exploit script I used was written none other than by the creator of the box themselves. They’ve actually written an interesting blog post on how they created Paper which you can find [here](https://secnigma.wordpress.com/2022/06/18/the-idea-behind-paper/).

## Enumeration
The initial Rustscan scan revealed ports 22, 80, and 443. Navigation to the machine’s IP in my web browser showed only a default CentOS landing page. Taking a closer look at the response headers sent back by the web server showed the unusual header of `x-backend-server: office.paper`. I set office.paper to resolve to the machine’s IP in my /etc/hosts file then navigated to it and found a Wordpress blog.

A wpscan scan showed a Wordpress version of 5.2.3 which is vulnerable to [CVE-2019-17671](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-17671).

## Foothold
CVE-2019-17671 is a vulnerability that allows the viewing of some usually private content by including the parameter static=1 in the request parameters. Using the payload `http://office.paper/?static=1ℴ=desc` I’m able to read some draft content which includes a reference to a “Secret Registration URL” at `http://chat.office.paper/register/8qozr226AhkCHZdyY`.

I add this subdomain to my /etc/hosts and navigate to the URL, where I’m able to create a Rocket Chat account and login to a Rocket Chat server. The main channel is read-only but scrolling through the chat history I find that the chat supports a Hubot integration. Two of the commands shown in this “recyclops” help command are the file command, to read a file, and the list command, to list out a directory’s contents.

I first try the command `recyclops file ../../../../etc/passwd` and confirm that this enables me to read whatever files on the system this bot has permission to view. 

Looking at the users in the /etc/passwd file, I see a user `dwight`. I check this user’s home directory and find the hubot’s config files. One of the script files picques my interest as it is named `run.js`. These are the file contents:

```javascript
// Description:
// Runs a command on hubot
// TOTAL VIOLATION of any and all security!
//
// Commands:
// hubot run <command> - runs a command on hubot host

module.exports = function(robot) {
    robot.respond("/RUN (.*)$/i", function(msg) {
        console.log(msg);
        var cmd = msg.match[1];
        msg.send("Running " + cmd);
        var exec = require('child_process').exec;
        exec(cmd, function(error, stdout, stderr) {
            if (error) {
                msg.send(error);
                msg.send(stderr);
            } else {
                msg.send(stdout);
            }
        });
    });
};
```

This code takes all output after a `recyclops run` command and passes it to Javascript’s exec() function, allowing for arbitrary command execution on the system. First, I check what user this bot is running as with `recyclops run id`. It’s running as `dwight`, perfect. Then, I use recyclops run `echo "<my ssh public key>" >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys` to load my public key into the user’s authorized ssh keys file and am then able to login as the user dwight with ssh.

$ ssh dwight@office.paper

```

## Privilege Escalation(s)
Running [linpeas](https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/tree/master/linPEAS) quickly shows that the machine is vulnerable to [CVE-2021-3560](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-3560) which exploits a race-condition in the relationship between polkit and dbus. There’s a [wonderfully written article](https://github.blog/2021-06-10-privilege-escalation-polkit-root-on-linux-with-bug/) explaining this vulnerability and I definitely recommend giving it a read.

A quick google search finds me [this](https://github.com/secnigma/CVE-2021-3560-Polkit-Privilege-Esclation) exploit code. I load the script onto the machine and run it a couple times until it successfully creates a user with full sudo privileges.

```text
[dwight@paper ~]$ ./poc.sh -u=ori -p=beans -f=y

[!] Username set as : ori
[!] No Custom Timing specified.
[!] Timing will be detected Automatically

[!] If the username is inserted, but the login fails; try running the exploit again.
[!] If the login was succesful,simply enter 'sudo bash' and drop into a root shell!
[dwight@paper ~]$ 
```
I then login with that user and become root.
