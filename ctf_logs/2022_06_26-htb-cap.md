Cap is an easy CTF from HackTheBox. It involves a bit of web app IDOR, pcap analysis, and a Polkit CVE privesc.

## Enumeration
Initial port enumeration with rustscan showed ports 21, 22, and 80 as open. I visit the web page and find an app showing the endpoints /capture, /ip, and /netstat. The capture endpoint is linked to with a button that says it makes a pcap of the last 5 seconds.

Using `/capture` redirects to a `/data/<Number>` endpoint, with the number incrementing with each capture. Thereâ€™s a download button on the page that uses `/download/<Number>` to download the pcap of the corresponding capture.

## Foothold
While `/data/0` revealed nothing, `/download/0` allowed me to download a pcap that was generated prior to my visiting the machine.

Looking through the pcap with wireshark I find the logs of an FTP session, revealing the username and password combination of `Nathan:Buck3tH4TF0RM3!`.

I test that combination against SSH and am able to get a session as the user nathan.

## Privilege Escalation(s)
To privesc I run linpeas and find that the machine is vulnerable to [CVE-2021-4034](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/50689). I paste the exploit code onto the machine and use make to compile everything together then run the exploit to get root.
