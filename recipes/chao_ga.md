### Backstory and also a Disclaimer

As a little kid, this was a comfort dish for me. It's something I'd eat whenever I got sick, and I continue this tradition today for myself and my friends.

It's how I learned to make it growing up, so even if it's not really typical chao ga, it's the version that I like.

### Ingredients

- **Chicken /w Bones and Skin** - Any part is fine, as long it's meaty.
- **Yellow Onion** 
- **Dried Shiitake Mushrooms**
- **Fish Sauce**
- **Rice** - I like jasmine rice or California rice.
- **Scallions**
- **Cilantro**
- **Sesame Oil**

### Method

1. Finely dice the `onions`, then sweat them in olive oil. 

2. Once the onions are soft and translucent, fill the pot with water. Put in the `chicken` and `dried shiitake mushrooms` and boil until chicken is cooked through.

3. Remove the chicken from the soup and put in some `rice`. I prefer to err on the side of less rice, for a soupier broth. Around 150g of rice for 3.5l of soup.

4. Debone and shred the chicken, put the bones back in the soup. Do what you want with the skin, I like to break it up and put it back in the soup too. Depending on the size of your mushrooms, take them out and chop them into pieces. Put those back in the soup as well.

5. Once the rice is cooked, return the chicken to the soup.

6. Season to taste with `fish sauce`, salt, and black pepper.

7. Garnish with lots of `scallions`, `cilantro`, and `sesame oil`. I like to top it with fresh black pepper as well.
